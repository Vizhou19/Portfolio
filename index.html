        <p class="self">
          Hi, My name is Rene Cardenas and I'm an Self-Taught Autistic Front-End
          Developer.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p class="background">
          I Graduate out of John B. Alexander High School in 2022, at the age of
          17. I've been learning about Programming from Codecademy and decided
          to become a Front-End Developer.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p class="free-time">
          During my Free Time, I like to play Pokemon GO to get some cardio. I
          also listen to Dark Ambient and Lofi music.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p class="special">
          I'm a Self-Taught Autistic, which means I have to learn things in my
          own. I'm also to able Adept at Mastering New Concepts.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p class="teamwork">
          I also like to break large projects into smaller, manageable pieces.
          This approach allows for easier refactoring, ensures the code stays
          modular and maintainable. Plus, it makes it easier to collaborate with
          others.
